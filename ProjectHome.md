Several experimental and not-so-experimental golang packages, including:

  * [sadbox/color](http://go.pkgdoc.org/code.google.com/p/sadbox/color): color models for Hex, HSL and HSV.
  * [sadbox/appengine/sessions](http://go.pkgdoc.org/code.google.com/p/sadbox/appengine/sessions): datastore and memcache session backends.

And a few others.
